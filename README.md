# RPP Architecture
This repository contains the initial draft of the RPP (RESTful Provisioning Protocol) architecture. The aim of this project is to leverage REST architectural principles and JSON data-interchange formats to enhance the existing Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP).

## Overview
The [Architecture.adoc](./Architecture.adoc) file outlines the core components, design considerations, and requirements for RPP. 

Key sections include:

* **Introduction:** Background on EPP and the motivation for RPP.
* **Terminology:** Definitions of key terms used in the document.
* **Requirements:** Essential and desirable features of RPP.
* **Architectural Overview:** General considerations about RPP architecture
* **Protocol Details:** More detailed description of the architecture layers and their components.

## Contributing
This draft is open for contributions and comments. We welcome feedback and suggestions to improve the architecture. To contribute, please submit a pull request or open an issue in this repository.
